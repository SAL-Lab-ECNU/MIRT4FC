Description: The objective of MIRT4FC is to efficiently implement various 
    forced-choice models using the istem algorithm.Currently, it includes 
    Thurstone's Item Response Theory (TIRT, Brown et al., 2011) Model, 
    Multi-Unidimensional Pairwise Preference Two Parameter Logistic Model 
    (MUPP-2PLM, Morillo et al., 2016) and we plan to continue updating and 
    adding new models in the future. 
    In addition to item parameter estimation capabilities, our R package also 
    offers the ability to estimate ability parameters using MAP, EAP, and MLE 
    methods. It can generate simulated response matrices, calculate standard 
    errors (SE) for both ability and item parameters, and include a set of 
    empirical data.
